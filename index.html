	<p class="regular_paragraph"> My name is Adan Lopez, I am an undergrad student at Tecnologico de Monterrey, in Monterrey, Mexico. I'm pursuing a degree in computer science, and entering my senior year. I've lived my entire life in Monterrey, I was born and raised here. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Recently I've been working at school projects, but also looking for temporary job opportunities. I like to attend lectures and learn from my teachers, but I feel I'm better learning on the go. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Recently I've done a few internships, and I've loved the experience of learning by doing. That's also why I'm eager to graduate and start working full-time.
